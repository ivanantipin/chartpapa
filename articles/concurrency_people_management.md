## Brainstorm

effective management.

People that manages IT companies get a lot of money.
Unfortunately these higly paid managers not alway doing good because they do not know IT stuff.
In my experience often handreed of peoples do not perform well. Why?
I keep an eye on success and not successes in organizations and spotted few things.

First it is well known but often not taken in effect that people forces not scaled linearly.
And in IT often one person could constituet great work force. ( Jeff Dean in google is well known example)

And I found the reason.




1. small tasks reduction
2. automate!! automate all tasks that can be automated. so called "senior managemnet" do not have a clue how much simple time reporting can take out of organization
3. reduce number meetings!! even short meeting having serios impact on your performance restoring context is quite expensive
4. shape IT infrastructure in a way when people can have integration with other systems without interaction of team backend the system API for rescue
5. scalability of teams organization
6. Similarity in concurrency and people management: people , teams, departments as they all have some kind of layered memory ( L1, L2 cacheds , RAM) etc.
7. Assigning task to people wisely. Tasks have to be big enough to grasp the context.
8. API for rescue how to reduce ? API for rescue !! good API and documentation reduces people communication and so context switches.
9. criticism of standard approach bananas etc.


10. explanation of brain work , contexts switches etc
parallel programming and people management what is common?
surprisingly approach is very similar.
if you imaging that person/developer is thread
then context switch would be extremely expensive in both cases.
try to do 3 tasks in parallel which requires some (diving deep - find synonym here)
and your performance could be decresesed times!!
this is because you brain works well with short term memory ( cache) and not so good with longer term.
you cant restore task context in a matter of minutes for small tasks
or even hours for bigger task you did not look for few days.
