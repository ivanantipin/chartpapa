I thought hype about scrum/agile is gone like 10 years ago but 
I noticed second wave of popularity in banks in particular.

For quite some time I did not pay attention as it was out of my area of interest.

Scrum masters were like a bees with important faces, they were harmful , flied around and tried to be
in good relationship with IT (me). So far so good.

At some point this noise stared bothering be 
and I asked myself why we have so much redundant stuff? 

is not it better to put efforts, money, resources on apparent things? 

Having dedicated man for jira management and asking stupid questions on standup meetings ? - sound like a nonsense

Apparent things is btw different long topic of discussion so I will just skip it for now.
 
so I gave it a thought... and came to the following conclusion why this is happening...

So we have some 'senior' management who do not have a clue about software development, they usually 
sweet talkers, diagram makers and office warriors of game of thrones.

So what do they do when they get some area responsibility, some piece of IT in our case.

- They try to understand what is going on. 
And this is kind of hard for these guys as they do not have IT background and different skill set ( see above). 

So they try to secure those work and surprisingly they attack the problem in IT/programmer way - they put an abstraction on 
top of 'thingy' they do not understand. 

Scrum, agile, enterprise architects is the name of that abstraction.
 
Bingo! 

it is super cool but in that bingo there is weak point - the abstraction is often not more proficient in IT  
than people who hired them.

So to survive they need to dance properly in between of IT and senior management.

That is why they are trying to own all channels of information from IT 
sabotaging any direct information flow from IT to business. 

In IT I see a lot of smart guys who really understand this mess 
they just too lazy to the case but just do not want to be get involved in different endevours
