###Game of Life in corporate universe.

Have you heard about game called [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970?

rules from wikipedia:

>>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid cells.
>> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
>> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
>> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
>> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell. 

I think that some of these rules apply to mechanics of corporate office universe.
Lets exclude rule  3. from consideration though.

Lets make funny naive assumption that bad employees are 'dead' and good employees are 'live' cells in our game.

'Good' and 'bad' are actually multidimensional term : from enthusiasm and qualification to temper, 
but we would collapse it to one dimension (good-bad), kind of extreme.


### Case 1 'live'  surrounded by 'dead-s'

If you are a 'live' cell surrounded by 'dead' ones in our terminology you most probably would adjust or leave.
By 'adjust' I mean your performance and behavior will be eventually 
aligned with rest of team because people are social animals.
So you will eventually become a 'dead' one or leave company. 

### Case 2 'dead' surrounded by 'live-s'

If you are a 'dead' cell and surrounded by good ones you would also feel uncomfortable for the very same reason
which would motivate you for an action - leave or try harder or do something good to align with rest.
So you effectively become 'live' or leave

### Why 'dead-s' have an advantage

Have you ever wondered why products of big corporates are often so shitty ?
(windows, lotus notes, skype,remedy - and i am not talking about inhouse infra products which are even worse)

Corps have tons of money to make them shiny but still cant do what small companies can.

I think one of the reasons that in big corps 'dead' cells as a class have evolutional advantage
though it sound counterintuitive.
So they are eventualy spreaded over without external intervention to improve situation. 


I have few reasons why:

1.  'Dead cell' are usually more reluctant for adjusting or resigning than 'live',
They could have less offers on the market so they prefer sit tight where they are
2.  to be in comfort they prefer hire same quality people and those do the same, and so on and so forth. 
Probably it would be better called 'game of death' instead or corporate cancer tumor.

Some famous person ( could be even dreadful Steeve Jobs ) even said:  
""Manager of class A tries to hire A+ manager and manager of B class tries to hire C class manager.""


You can easily extrapolate what would happen with company after a few iterations in both cases... 

Multiplication by number 1.01 tends to increase to infinity, multiplication by number 0.99 tends to decrease to zero - simple math.
 
### Good tech companies know!

Good tech companies like Google, Facebook etc.  famous for those tough interviews 
( author also tried it few times without big success)

They often hire overqualified people for particilar work just to avoid mentioned death spiral, influenca ( you name it)

Ther know that sneaky dead cells are not issusional danger for company.

Combating for corporate culture, keeping qualification bar high is one of most important duties management shall take care of
as it is much easier to prevent illness that treat it. Seems that many top managers do not realise that maybe they do
but this battle for culture is not a low hanging fruit it instead plant grow and get result in many years - which is hard to 
project to bonuses. 
 
## Chance for survival for infected company

In opposite to the "game of life" company microcosm is open system
people come and leave, also cells are not equally powerful - CEO and general
programmer for sure have different impact on company.

in game of life all cells are equals but in corporate Life game it is hierarchical so tops having much more impact to downstreams.

So replacing CEO can have huge impact even for company in terminal stage. 

Also I am more optimistic about companies with big shareholder(s) who also works in the same company. 
Shareholders intervention as they are main interresants in company prosperity 
but often on that high level there is no transparancy what is going on in company.
So they can replace tops and this is still a litle bit of lottery.
