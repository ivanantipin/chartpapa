###Game of Life in corporate universe.

Have you heard about game called [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970?

Rules of the game are pretty simple ( extract from wikipedia) : 

##### The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

* add here something about model development

I found it has some similiarities with corporate universe mechanics.

Lets assume that:

1. Alive cells are good employees - people with right incentives and qualification, who really likes those job and want to make a difference.
2. Dead cells are bad employees - people who just carry on , do not care about what they do , sit working hours and go home etc

Real life is not about black and white though, but lets take this definition as extreme - in the end all models are just rough 
approximation of reality.

Imaging that you are a "live cell" according to definition and imagine that you are surrounded by "dead cells", 
dudes without interest and probably with low qualification as these 2 qualities are positively correlated.
When number of surrounding you 'live cells' reduced down to some threshold I bet your enthusiasm would not last long 
and you either leave company or adjust to environment so essentially become 'dead cell' because human beans are social creatures. 
Once you are dead cell you willingly or not will infect other people who are not yet 'dead' and so on and so forth.

In opposite case there is similar mechanics, 'dead cell' start feeling discomfort being surrounded by 
good emploees and this motivates him/she to either adjust or resign.  
 
Bad part that dead cells usually win. Why?

I noticed that low qualified stuff often stay longer in company.
Less offer on the market so they stay sit.

'Dead cell' are usually more reluctant for adjusting or resigning than 'live',



*
they start so they are like cancer tumor spread all over organization bringing and promoting same 
type of persons as they are.



They often mimic 'live' especially for upstream management and if upstream management is not qualified 
enough to recognize this it tends to spread. 
Still rule #4 applies to some extent.
Also in the model 'dead' cell could become 'alive', but in real life some emploees 
are really 'dead cells' and there is no such environment conditions that could possibly resurrect them, because they are what they are.
*and if such a person hired by mistake it tends to stay long as 
you need to have very serious reason to fire people and lack of enthusiasm hardly could be a reason for that.


Good companies like Google, Facebook etc. are known for those tough interview process
and apparently this is for the reason, as they understand how dangerous to let 'dead cells' get into the company.

In my opinion combating for corporate culture, keeping qualification bar high is one of most important duties management shall take care of
as it is much easier to prevent illness that treat it.
 

I witnessed few times in my life when teams/departments converted from pretty solid IT guilds 
to programmers hospice and burocracy heavens.
  
I heard some famous person ( maybe it was Steeve Jobs though I am not sure) once said 
that manager of class A tries to hire A+ manager and manager of B class tries to hire C class manager.
My understanding of that is A class manager means here qualified person with incentives aligned with company prosperity,
and incentive of B class manager is job security, so C class subordinate would mean for this type of manager less competition and risk.
 
You can easily extrapolate what would happen with company after a few iterations. 
because multiplication by number 1.01 tends to increase, multiplication by number 0.99 tends to decrease.


Few things could save company though:

1. Shareholders intervention as they are main interresants in company prosperity 
but often on that high level there is no transparancy what is going on in company.
So they can replace tops and this is still a litle bit of lottery.

That is why I am more optimistic about companies with big shareholder who also works in the same company.

2. in Life game all cells are equals but in corporate Life game it is hierarchical so tops having much more impact to downstreams.


this model is just reduced in dimension projection of corparate jungles and just one side of mechanics.
There is another super strong force not covered in this model called results dressing when people just concerned about making those 
careers no matter what. but this is different story.
