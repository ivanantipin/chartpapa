In the past few years, I noticed that the so-called scrum-agile-extreme programming has got a second life.


For some dateTime I did not pay attention to it, scrum masters fluttered around with clever faces, but in fact they were harmless like butterflies
and that's why I did not soar. And at some point in the reflection, I was puzzled with what this anomaly is connected with.

The fact is that I am personally skeptical about the religion of scrum, especially if it is viewed as a silver bullet.
Progs are cracking problems not the scrum musters. If the IT stuff is shit, then no one scrum master would pull out - shit-in-shit-out as they say.
 
I thought a while about this and came to some conclusion ...

Let's take for example average "senior management" in non-IT organizations. They are good at sweet speaking,
diagrams drawing and working the angles, but, as you may notice, software making is absent in this list of skills.

When such a manager got piece of happiness in the form of IT department he starts scratching his head and thinking about what to do about it.

Then, he/she usually comes up with a brilliant idea, to abstract himself from the stupid programmers with an intelligent layer
in the form of all sorts of masters: scram, agile, yoda masters and enterprise architects who would translate binary thoughts of IT developers into something
understandable i.e. powerpoint presentation.

Bingo! the question is settled, the pigs are loaded, the scrum masters are hired, everything works in a bunch.

there is only one small problem, all these scrum idlers usually understand in no way more than the notorious "senior management" and
they, in turn, would not mind abstracting from low-level items, but who would give them.

so they have to dance between their bosses and progs in order to reach out longer, earn more.

There is zero profit in this setup, this "master" layer usually acts as Chinese whispers ,
if successful, they beat themselves with a heel in their chests and report on another success story, in the event of a failure, they all fall for prog.

I have never witnessed when a master's scrum really solved problems, at the same dateTime I
many times witnessed when a modest kid, like me, pulled out decent projects over which the hordes of nedprogs with the skraf of the brotherhood were piling.

Steve Jobs, by the way, did not hesitate to press the buttons on the iPhone checking whether it is convenient.

In fact, the whole story, the American management model does not work from the word at all.
for those who do not know about this American in which managers are not going through the food chain of the career path,
in contrast to the Japanese.

I'm for the Japanese !!

how can I write about the enterprise architecture of my little football fans.
